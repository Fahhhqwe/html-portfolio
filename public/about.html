<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At just 19 years old, a second-year software engineering student at Burapha University, 
  Bangsaen Campus, is embarking on a journey filled with both challenges and aspirations. 
  Unlike many who have been coding since childhood, this student took a different path, 
  stepping into the world of software development with fresh curiosity and determination. 
  The road may be steep, but every line of code written is a step toward mastering a craft 
  that powers the modern digital world.</p>

<p>Though coding is not yet a natural strength, perseverance is the guiding force. Hours 
  are spent debugging, learning new programming languages, and grasping complex algorithms. 
  The struggle is real, but so is the passion to improve. Each small success—a function that 
  finally works, a database query that returns the right results—fuels the motivation to keep 
  going. The belief that mastery comes with persistence keeps the spirit alive, even when faced 
  with overwhelming challenges.</p>

<p>In this pursuit of excellence, growth is not measured by speed but by consistency. With 
  each passing day, the ability to think like a developer sharpens, and problem-solving skills 
  evolve. The dream is not just to become proficient in coding but to create software that makes 
  a difference. The journey may have started with uncertainty, but the destination is clear: to 
  transform from a student into a skilled software engineer, ready to take on the ever-evolving 
  tech industry.</p>
